DesignPattern 

Followed Spring MVC design pattern along with integration 

model- spring beans
view- jsp
control- MainController handling requests

There are 3 modules
1. Controller Module which interacts with JSPs and requests ServiceModule for service
2. Service Module which takes the request from ControllerModule and requests DAO for required action
3. The DAO module receives request from Service Module and interacts with Database for results.

We have this 3 layered design. This design is useful if we were to extend this application. for example, this is a web application. Lets us say we want to implement mobile feature for this application. we can include another service module which handles the requests for mobile application.

Steps to Run and Test the code

Used Tomcat 7 Application server to test this application.

Run the project on server.

1. To test for validations, simply press submit in the home page. we will get the required validations when we do this.
2. To test for duplicate songName and artistName, try to enter existing songName and artistName. Then it gives the error message in another page.
3. Test the functionalities
	a. Add- fill the form and press submit	
	b. search- enter partial of full songname of artistname you would like to search for
	c. edit- click on the edit link present in the list. The fields are populated with the song to be edited. Edit the list and submit the form again.
	d. delete- click on the delete link next to the song to delete that particular song.
